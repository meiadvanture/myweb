Two and a half years after completing this trail, I’m finally writing its journal. To this day, it remains one of my all-time favourite backpacking adventures.  Though [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/happy-isles-vernall-falls-half-dome-tenaya-lake-and-mirror-lakes-loop-7744129) lists it as 30 miles, I'm still not sure how we did 37 miles with 10,300 feet of elevation gain, but well my legs certainly felt every bit of it!

On the first day, after hiking up from the valley to Little Yosemite Valley, we left our backpack at the campsite and headed to Half Dome. I nearly abandoned my attempt to summit Half Dome but Curtis’s abundant patience and encouragement kept me moving. (Many thanks!) And... it was absolutely worth it! We reached the cables about an hour before sunset. There were only a few other people around and the view from the top was spetacular!

This trip was also full of firsts.

As I close this chapter of memories, I’m reminded that this trail wasn’t just about the miles or the summits, it was also about the moments where I pushed myself just a little more than my limits and discovering the beauty of nature via type-2 fun. 
Perhaps life is like this backpacking trip, that after enduring the hardships, something beautiful will emerge. :)
