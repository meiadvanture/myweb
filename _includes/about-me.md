<!-- A B2B sales professional with a high school foundation in art and a background in statistics and data analytics from my undergraduate and graduate studies. -->

**In my free time**, you’ll likely find me backpacking, hiking, camping, skiing, snowboarding, or swaying in my hammock for a great afternoon nap. I am also a big fan of swing dancing! 
When I'm not outdoors, I’m all about crocheting, knitting, macraméing, or bringing my woodworking designs to life.
